2. If the number os users of a system is increasing considerably over a short period of time, it needs to scale. Scaling
a system can usually be done in two ways: horizontal scaling or vertical scaling. Horizontal scaling means that
you scale by adding more machines into your pool of resources whereas Vertical scaling means that you scale by adding
more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine. In general, horizontal scaling works better than vertical scaling.

In the case of the developed system, we can scale each of its three layers horizontally, in response to an increase
in load. More specifically:

- Frontend Layer: 
- Backend Layer:
- Database Layer:
